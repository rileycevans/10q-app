# Rule Creation Guidelines

## Context

- Apply when creating, updating, or reviewing any CursorAI rule file.
- Ensures all rules follow consistent structure and formatting for optimal AI interpretability.
- This meta-rule defines the standard template for all future rules.
- Rules use "Apply Intelligently" - they are dynamically applied based on relevance to the current task.

## Requirements

### Frontmatter (YAML)

- Include YAML frontmatter at the top, delimited by `---` lines.
- **CRITICAL: `description` field is the primary trigger for rule visibility** - the AI uses this to determine if a rule is relevant to the current task.
- Write `description` as a brief, semantic summary (under ~120 characters) in "action/trigger/outcome" style.
- Use specific, descriptive keywords in the description that match the contexts where the rule should apply.
- **Use "Apply Intelligently" by default** - omit `alwaysApply` or set `alwaysApply: false` to enable dynamic rule selection based on the description.
- Only use `alwaysApply: true` for truly universal rules that must be considered in every context (rare).
- Keep frontmatter minimal - avoid unnecessary metadata fields.

### Structure

- Use H1 heading (`#`) for the rule title - descriptive and specific.
- Include `## Context` section explaining when/why to apply the rule.
- Include `## Requirements` (or `## Guidelines` or `## Critical Rules`) with specific directives.
- Include `## Examples` with at least one valid and one invalid example.

### Content Formatting

- Use bullet points for requirements, not paragraphs.
- Each requirement must be a single, actionable directive starting with an imperative verb.
- Each requirement must be testable/verifiable.
- Keep language concise and direct - avoid verbose explanations.
- Use 2-space indentation within XML-style tags (e.g., `<example>` blocks).

### Examples

- Use `<example>` tags for valid examples with brief explanations.
- Use `<example type="invalid">` tags for invalid examples with explanations.
- Keep examples short and focused on demonstrating the rule.
- Indent content within example tags by 2 spaces.

### Scope and Organization

- One rule file = one purpose/domain (e.g., separate rules for styling, testing, naming).
- Keep each rule file under ~200 lines.
- **If a rule exceeds ~200 lines, split it into multiple focused rules** - create separate rule files for distinct concerns rather than one large rule.
- Use descriptive filenames that indicate the rule's purpose (e.g., `feature-modules.mdc`, `module-boundaries.mdc`, `project-structure.mdc`).
- **Do not prefix filenames with the project/app name** - all rules in `.cursor/rules/` are already scoped to the project, so prefixes are redundant.
- Store rules in `.cursor/rules/` directory.
- Avoid overlapping or conflicting rules - resolve conflicts explicitly.

### Length and Detail

- Prioritize high information density - remove redundancy.
- Provide sufficient detail to avoid ambiguity.
- Use examples instead of lengthy explanations when possible.
- Be concise but complete - cover what's needed, nothing more.
- **When creating or updating a rule, if it approaches or exceeds ~200 lines, split it into multiple rules** - identify distinct concerns and create separate rule files for each.

## Examples

<example>
  ---
  description: "Enforce Python naming conventions following PEP8 standards."
  ---
  # Python Naming Conventions

  ## Context
  - Apply when writing or reviewing Python source files.
  - The description includes keywords like "Python", "naming conventions", and "PEP8" which help the AI identify when this rule is relevant via "Apply Intelligently".

  ## Requirements
  - Use snake_case for function and variable names.
  - Use PascalCase for class names.
  - Use UPPER_CASE for constants.

  ## Examples
  <example>
    Valid: `def load_data():`, `class DataLoader:`, `MAX_RETRIES = 3`
  </example>
  <example type="invalid">
    Invalid: `def LoadData():`, `class dataLoader:`, `maxRetries = 3`
  </example>
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  # Python code style

  Please follow good coding practices. Use nice names and make code look professional. Try to be consistent.

  This is invalid because it lacks frontmatter, structure, specific requirements, and examples. The instructions are vague and not testable.
