# UI Acceptance Checklist

## Context

- Apply when reviewing UI implementations before merging or shipping.
- Use this checklist to verify components match the neo-brutalist arcade style.
- Every item must be satisfied for UI to be considered complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Style

- [ ] Every major surface and button has a thick black outline (3–4px).
- [ ] Shadows are flat, offset, ink-colored (`#1A1A21`), not blurred gray.
- [ ] Background has halftone dots and burst rays (never flat solid).
- [ ] Main card is paper/white (`#F5F7F7`), chunky, rounded (24px), shadowed (8px 8px 0).
- [ ] Answer buttons are tall (56px+) and feel tappable.
- [ ] Selected state uses solid bright fill (green) while keeping black border.
- [ ] Typography is bold (800) and playful; labels are uppercase pills.
- [ ] UI looks good at 390×844 (iPhone-ish) and scales to desktop centered.

### Design Tokens

- [ ] All colors come from defined tokens (ink, paper, purpleA, purpleB, green, red, etc.).
- [ ] Spacing uses defined tokens (gutter: 16px, stackGap: 12px, etc.).
- [ ] Border radius uses tokens (24px cards, 18px buttons).
- [ ] Shadows use custom utilities (`.shadow-sticker`, `.shadow-sticker-sm`).

### Components

- [ ] HUD has proper styling (3px border, paper background, 4px shadow).
- [ ] Question card follows exact spec (paper bg, 4px border, 24px radius, 8px shadow).
- [ ] Answer buttons have correct default and selected states.
- [ ] Bottom dock buttons are square (48–56px) with thick borders and shadows.

### Typography

- [ ] Question text: bold 800, 20–24px, left-aligned.
- [ ] Answer text: bold 800, 16–18px, centered.
- [ ] Category/round pills: uppercase, 12px, 0.08em letter-spacing.
- [ ] Fonts loaded from Google Fonts (Rubik/Nunito for body, Bungee/Luckiest Guy for headings).

### Interactions

- [ ] Button press uses scale + shadow shift (translate 2px, shadow reduces).
- [ ] Hover (desktop) raises slightly (translate -1px) with unchanged shadow.
- [ ] Screen transitions are snappy (180–240ms, ease-out).
- [ ] Progress bars animate smoothly.

### Accessibility

- [ ] All touch targets are 44px minimum (buttons are 56px+).
- [ ] Correctness feedback includes non-color indicators (icon/text).
- [ ] Focus states are visible and game-like.
- [ ] Reduced motion is respected.

### Background

- [ ] Background uses 3-layer recipe (gradient + halftone + radial burst).
- [ ] Never uses flat solid background.
- [ ] Halftone dots are visible and subtle (opacity 0.55, soft-light blend).
